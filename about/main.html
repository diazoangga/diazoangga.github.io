      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm <strong class="highlight">Diaz Angga Permana</strong>, a passionate AI researcher and software developer.
        My interests lie in <strong class="highlight">machine learning</strong>, <strong class="highlight">computer vision</strong>, and
        <strong class="highlight">mathematical modeling</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love exploring how mathematical theory supports modern AI and how we can leverage that to build robust applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of tech, I enjoy sharing knowledge, writing articles, and continuously learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey into AI began in 2016, when I wrote about an intelligent control system for traffic lights and had it published in 2017. 
        Then, in 2019 I started my career as an automation engineer at Subaru after earning my Bachelor's degree. 
        Over three years in the industry performing automation tasks, I found myself increasingly drawn to the world of AI in automation. 
        After dedicating time to online courses and self-study, I made the leap into AI engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2021, I started a Medium blog to document my project experiments and break down complex research papers into digestible insights. 
        It became a way to share knowledge and refine my understanding.

        <h2>Ideas I Live By</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Curiosity Fuels Growth</strong> â€“ The more I explore, the more I realize how much there is to learn. Curiosity keeps me moving forward.</li>
          <li><strong>Automation Unlocks Potential</strong> â€“ Repetitive tasks drain creativity. By automating the mundane, we create space for innovation.</li>
          <li><strong>Math is the Language of AI</strong> â€“ Understanding AI at a fundamental level means appreciating the mathematical beauty behind it.</li>
          <li><strong>Share Knowledge, Elevate Others</strong> â€“ Knowledge is most powerful when shared. Writing and teaching help solidify concepts and inspire new ideas.</li>
          <li><strong>AI for Learning Human</strong> â€“ While machines and humans learn differently, studying AI is a way to appreciate the incredible complexity of human learning.</li>
